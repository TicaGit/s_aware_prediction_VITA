The only real data are train and test.

I had also test_private in this folder (same as test, but with the ground truth), but the data is kept "secret". Synth data was downloaded on AIcrowd

The rest of the data are the ones generated by *evaluator/trajnet_evaluator.py*, for the AI crowd submission test.
